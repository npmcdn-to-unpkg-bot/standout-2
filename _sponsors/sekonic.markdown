desc: 'Sekonic Corporation, based in Japan, provides the widest range of light measurement
  devices for photographers around the world. Established in 1951, the first Sekonic
  brand exposure meter introduced was the revolutionary Sekonic P-1. In 1984, the
  Sekonic Digipro X-1 and L-518 meters were taken into space on the NASA Space Shuttle.
  This year, Sekonic celebrates its 60th anniversary while continuing to produce and
  develop meters for the film, video, cinematography and digital photography markets.
