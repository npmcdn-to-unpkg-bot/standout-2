desc: I’ll take you through the world of commercial and editorial retouching. We’ll
  look at the core principles of efficient retouching and the industry standards.
  I’ll showcase what retouching is and what it isn’t, and what photographers should
  do to ensure the files are perfectly shot for the intent of post production. You’ll
  get to see the business side, all the way from the job inquiry to the communication
  between myself and the client. It will encompass each step from the first e-mail
  all the way to the invoicing. We’ll get to see the tools of the trade as a retoucher,
  including equipment and Wacom graphic tablets that are needed as a retoucher.
