desc: Being a great photographer is one thing, effectively communicating that expertise
  to clients is quite another. Join Wonderful Machine CEO Bill Cramer as he discusses
  how to determine your core brand and how to express it throughout all of your marketing
  materials. Starting with the question, “what kinds of pictures do you take, and
  for what kinds of clients?” Bill will help you understand how to reconcile your
  interests, your skills, and the opportunities in the marketplace to maximize your
  success. He’ll then follow up with examples of the branding efforts of some of Wonderful
  Machine’s most accomplished photographers.
