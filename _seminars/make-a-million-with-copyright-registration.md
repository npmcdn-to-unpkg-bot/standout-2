desc: 'Have you ever seen your work used on the Internet without your permission –
  only to find out that there’s little you can do because you hadn’t registered your
  images? Have you watched your stock photography sales dwindling due to rampant image
  theft on the Internet? We’ve all spent a great deal of time learning our craft,
  buying the right equipment and working hard at making impactful images with one
  simple goal: to make a living doing something we like. The only way to protect your
  work and make a living in photography is through copyright registration.'
