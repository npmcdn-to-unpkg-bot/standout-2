desc: Have you ever looked an advertising campaign and thought to yourself, I could
  have shot that? But you didn’t. Why? There is no universal path to a successful
  photography career but I have seen the road change in my 15 years as a working professional.
  The modern day photographer is like a musician — where a jack of all trades gets
  you heard by no-one. Sure you could have shot that advertising campaign technically,
  the same way a young kid in the garage can play Metallica’s Enter Sandman… after
  all doing what someone else has done is easier than ever. This short talk will explore
  the importance of creating a voice in the noise of content creation. How sharing
  your story is as important as ever. And how having a goddamn opinion is a creative
  director's dream.
