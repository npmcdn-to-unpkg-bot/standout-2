desc: Becoming a photographer isn't as easy as buying a camera and following a few
  tutorials, unfortunately there is a lot more you have to consider before quitting
  your day job and following your passion. For those with the desire to do so, the
  strategy I chose wasnâ€™t quick and it wasn't easy. I offer no shortcuts and no magic
  answers. What you will learn is sure-fire, safe and reliable way to smoothly start
  a career driven by the art you love. I will explain how to properly transition your
  labor, how to select your initial target market, and how to eventually get paid
  doing exactly what you dreamed.
