desc: He has lived in a van. He has climbed mountains. He has leaped from planes.
  And, for many years, he could barely pay the phone bill.  Photographer Clay Cook
  has lived life in the front seat of a roller coaster. His experiences and work ethic
  have paved a path for success in just under five years as an editorial and advertising
  photographer. From an arduous life as a touring musician to documentary work throughout
  Tanzania, Ethiopia, Nepal and India, Clay has learned the importance of going the
  extra mile and taking critical risks. In this exclusive seminar, Clay will expose
  the story of how he strategically moved up the ladder and with the deck stacked
  against him, chose to never give up.
