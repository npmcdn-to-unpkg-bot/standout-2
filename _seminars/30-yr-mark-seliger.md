desc: Mark Seliger will walk viewers through the span of his 30­year career covering his many different genres and styles of shooting. Seliger’s work, which ranges from portraits of musicians and artists to Presidents and cultural icons from around the world, has been seen on the covers of Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Details and L’Uomo Vogue among others.

He will discuss shooting for a specific purpose, a cover for example, and the challenges and opportunities of such a process. Seliger will also discuss his fine art photography, which he has pursued alongside his commercial work.
