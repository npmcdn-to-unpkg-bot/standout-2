bio: Michael has been working in the photography industry for over 7 years. While
  photographing paid assignments, from commercial ad campaigns to weddings, Bonocore
  realized his passion for traveling with camera in hand was too great to ignore.
  He started visiting locations all over the globe, documenting not only the beautiful
  landscapes of the countries he visited, but also the lives of the local communities. Bonocore began
  working with international nonprofit organizations to help bring awareness to the
  causes that he was passionate about. Through the workshops he leads for The Giving
  Lens, he has taught children the art of photography in countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua,
  Peru, Jordan, Morocco, Thailand and India. Also in Thailand, he has documented the
  work of elephant sanctuaries he has helped bring awareness to Women’s Cooperatives
  in the Middle East. His passion for travel and photography has led to his new career
  as Travel Editor for Resource Travel. You can see more of Michael’s work on his website, Instagram,
  and Facebook.
