bio: 'Tim Kemple is a photographer and motion director who''s striking photography
  and film capture unique, never-before moments of athleticism and landscape from
  outside the walls of the traditional studio. From an early career documenting expeditions
  to Nepal, Pakistan, China, Chile, Eastern Europe, and Patagonia for editorial publications
  like National Geographic Adventure, Outside, and Men''s Journal; Tim has frequently
  harnessed the potential of modern technology to tell stories in a progressive way.
  From the transition of analog film to digital nearly 20 years ago to the cutting
  edge of today with 360 VR experiences, he is driven to find new ways to capture
  stories that people will share and remember. His commercial work was born from the
  same emotive, expedition story telling -- frequently capturing campaigns for the
  biggest brands in the outdoor industry: The North Face, Columbia Sportswear, and
  Mountain Hardwear. This authenticity in imagery and creative perspective has since
  led to advertising campaigns in the automotive and transportation industries for
  brands such as: Mitsubishi, Range Rover, Ram, Michellin, Amtrak, New Holland, and
  Farm Credit. Tim is still active in the outdoor industry, both behind and in front
  of the lens. He is a founding partner in Camp4 Collective, a film production studio
  who''s work spans the globe capturing everything from short :30 TV commercials to
  long form documentaries for outlets like National Geographic TV. You can catch him
  once in a blue moon at his studio in Salt Lake City or more likely on a powder day
  skiing in the Wasatch. To see his work and follow his stories he can be found on
  Instagram.'
