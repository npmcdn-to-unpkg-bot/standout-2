bio: 'Every photograph begins with an idea. The job of a photographer is to not only
  capture the vision, but manipulate it into art, bigger than life and beyond any
  initial expectations. Photographer, Clay Cook, has learned the importance of going
  the extra mile, after a long, arduous run in the music business. As a result, his
  wisdom, field experience and work ethic has pushed him further into an inspiring
  career in Advertising and Editorial photography. Over a short period of time, Clay
  has shaped creative projects with brands such as: Livestrong, NFL, Dillard''s and
  Vince Camuto. In addition, he has brought to life, worldwide assignments for publications
  such as USA Today, ESPN, Modern Salon and Inc. Magazine. Along with the desire to
  offer loyal solutions for every project, Clay can spread the word with the help
  of a large social media and blogging community. Start with an idea and Clay will
  lead it to a roaring finish line.'
