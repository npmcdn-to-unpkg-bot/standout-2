  and internationally renowned photographer of celebrity portraits, advertising and

  and sought after visual storytellers in the world, his artistic, conceptual vision
  and signature dramatic lighting create distinctive images that are dramatic, evocative,
  sophisticated, ironic, and comedic. Known for his high-concept imagery, Grecco is
  also famed for his innate ability to connect with each subject. Grecco is an expert
  and celebrated speaker on creativity, photography, and his signature lighting and
  directorial techniques. Having been dubbed “A Master of Light” by his peers, Grecco
  wholeheartedly admits his fascination with light and its effect in each and every
  photograph he takes. “Light is something I have studied, played with, and have been
  captivated by for decades. I find magic in its qualities. I have an immense passion
  for ‘molding’ light in order to create the shot that immortalizes a moment and induces
  an emotion. A reaction.” Grecco serves as the chair of the Advocacy Committee for
  APA National. He plays an important roll in serving the industry by fighting for
  the rights of photographers and helping protect the interests of image creators.
