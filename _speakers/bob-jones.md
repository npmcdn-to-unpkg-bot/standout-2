bio: Mark Seliger was born in Amarillo Texas in 1959, where he lived with his parents, Maurice and Carol Lee, and his two older brothers and younger sister, until 1964, when they moved to Houston. Seligerâ€™s early interest in photography began when his brother Frank promised to give him his Diana camera if he got a base hit in Little League.
