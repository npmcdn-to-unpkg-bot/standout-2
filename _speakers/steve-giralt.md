bio: Steve Giralt is a very passionate Miami, FL born cuban photographer who likes
  to smile a lot and is fun at parties. Although he comes from a family of engineers,
  he studied advertising photography at Rochester Institute of Technology. While at
  RIT he didn’t sleep very often, but won lots of awards. His work spans many different
  genres from people, the places they occupy, the things they own, or the many things
  they’d like to own. Steve is no longer a photographer by choice, it’s at the very
  root of who he is as a person. Taking the best picture possible and pushing the
  limits is the end goal of every photograph he ever takes.In 2005 Steve was selected
  as one of PDN magazine’s 30 emerging photographers to watch. In 2006 www.stevegiralt.com
  won an award as part of PDN’s digital PIX imaging awards. Now, Steve spends most
  of his time in his Manhattan studio with his dog Humphrey Bogart, upstate NY building
  things in his workshop, at home in Brooklyn with his family, or finding a new adventure
  somewhere. Steve still does not sleep very much.
