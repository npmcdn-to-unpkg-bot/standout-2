bio: Mark Seliger was born in Amarillo Texas in 1959, where he lived with his parents,
  Maurice and Carol Lee, and his two older brothers and younger sister, until 1964,
  when they moved to Houston. Seliger’s early interest in photography began when his
  brother Frank promised to give him his Diana camera if he got a base hit in Little
  League. He didn’t get the hit, but he got on base (by getting a walk for getting
  hit in the shoulder with the ball), and the camera was his. His first love quickly
  became the darkroom where he began experimenting with printing and developing in
  the family’s bathroom. He attended Houston’s High School for Performing & Visual
  Arts and, from there, went on to attend East Texas State University, where his education
  began in earnest, as he studied the history of documentary photography. He moved
  to New York City in 1984. In 1987, he began shooting for Rolling Stone. He was signed
  as their Chief Photographer in 1992.
