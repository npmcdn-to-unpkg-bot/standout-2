            <p>Mark Seliger was born in Amarillo Texas in 1959, where he lived with his parents, Maurice and Carol Lee, and his two older brothers and younger sister, until 1964, when they moved to Houston. Seliger’s early interest in photography began when his brother Frank promised to give him his Diana camera if he got a base hit in Little League. He didn’t get the hit, but he got on base (by getting a walk for getting hit in the shoulder with the ball), and the camera was his. His first love quickly became the darkroom where he began experimenting with printing and developing in the family’s bathroom. He attended Houston’s High School for Performing & Visual Arts and, from there, went on to attend East Texas State University, where his education began in earnest, as he studied the history of documentary photography. He moved to New York City in 1984. In 1987, he began shooting for Rolling Stone. He was signed as their Chief Photographer in 1992.</p>

          <h3>"A 30 Year Retrospective Covering the Iconic Career of Mark Seliger"</h3>
          <p>Mark Seliger will walk viewers through the span of his 30­year career covering his many different genres and styles of shooting. Seliger’s work, which ranges from portraits of musicians and artists to Presidents and cultural icons from around the world, has been seen on the covers of Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Details and L’Uomo Vogue among others. He will discuss his method of working with his subjects; understanding how they perceive their own image and working with that idea to come up with the final image. He will discuss shooting for a specific purpose, a cover for example, and the challenges and opportunities of such a process. Seliger will also discuss his fine art photography, which he has pursued alongside his commercial work.</p>

            <p>Steve Giralt is a very passionate Miami, FL born cuban photographer who likes to smile a lot and is fun at parties. Although he comes from a family of engineers, he studied advertising photography at Rochester Institute of Technology. While at RIT he didn’t sleep very often, but won lots of awards. His work spans many different genres from people, the places they occupy, the things they own, or the many things they’d like to own. Steve is no longer a photographer by choice, it’s at the very root of who he is as a person. Taking the best picture possible and pushing the limits is the end goal of every photograph he ever takes.In 2005 Steve was selected as one of PDN magazine’s 30 emerging photographers to watch. In 2006 www.stevegiralt.com won an award as part of PDN’s digital PIX imaging awards. Now, Steve spends most of his time in his Manhattan studio with his dog Humphrey Bogart, upstate NY building things in his workshop, at home in Brooklyn with his family, or finding a new adventure somewhere. Steve still does not sleep very much.</p>
