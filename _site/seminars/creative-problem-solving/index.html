            <p>Tim Kemple is a photographer and motion director who's striking photography and film capture unique, never-before moments of athleticism and landscape from outside the walls of the traditional studio. From an early career documenting expeditions to Nepal, Pakistan, China, Chile, Eastern Europe, and Patagonia for editorial publications like National Geographic Adventure, Outside, and Men's Journal; Tim has frequently harnessed the potential of modern technology to tell stories in a progressive way. From the transition of analog film to digital nearly 20 years ago to the cutting edge of today with 360 VR experiences, he is driven to find new ways to capture stories that people will share and remember. His commercial work was born from the same emotive, expedition story telling -- frequently capturing campaigns for the biggest brands in the outdoor industry: The North Face, Columbia Sportswear, and Mountain Hardwear. This authenticity in imagery and creative perspective has since led to advertising campaigns in the automotive and transportation industries for brands such as: Mitsubishi, Range Rover, Ram, Michellin, Amtrak, New Holland, and Farm Credit. Tim is still active in the outdoor industry, both behind and in front of the lens. He is a founding partner in Camp4 Collective, a film production studio who's work spans the globe capturing everything from short :30 TV commercials to long form documentaries for outlets like National Geographic TV. You can catch him once in a blue moon at his studio in Salt Lake City or more likely on a powder day skiing in the Wasatch. To see his work and follow his stories he can be found on Instagram.</p>

          <p>Have you ever looked an advertising campaign and thought to yourself, I could have shot that? But you didn’t. Why? There is no universal path to a successful photography career but I have seen the road change in my 15 years as a working professional. The modern day photographer is like a musician — where a jack of all trades gets you heard by no-one. Sure you could have shot that advertising campaign technically, the same way a young kid in the garage can play Metallica’s Enter Sandman… after all doing what someone else has done is easier than ever. This short talk will explore the importance of creating a voice in the noise of content creation. How sharing your story is as important as ever. And how having a goddamn opinion is a creative director's dream.</p>
